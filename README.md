# Shifting Sands

This is the public repository for my game, Shifting Sands. It is a puzzle-platformer with boolean algebra puzzles and elements of time travel, with a linear narrative. Coded in GameMaker Language (GML), and made in GameMaker Studio, this project is my first full exploration of game design and development, and uses my own pixelart, a skill I am developing alongside the more technical aspects.

## Availability

I have provided this public repository to aid employers in gaining insight into my coding style and aptitude, as well as act as part of a portfolio of my work. I do not intend to leave the repo public, and it may be turned private at any time. The full project may be replaced with coding samples, and I will not update this page regularly to prevent issues arising in the future should I take this game to market. Likely, I will turn this repository into a "demo" version.

## Running the game
1. Download the .zip file.
2. Extract the file.
3. Run the executable

The character can be controlled with WASD, additional controls vary depending on the stage the game is in. Q and E are likely to control time-shifting when this is enabled.
